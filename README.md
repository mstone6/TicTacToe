# TicTacToe
Text-Based Tic-Tac-Toe with Queue-Based Player Turns

 

Game Rules:

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Two players take turns, one using "X" and the other using "O."
- The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- If the grid is filled without a winner, the game is a draw.
Queue-Based Player Turns:

- Implement a queue-based approach to determine the order of player turns. Use a queue data structure to manage player 
turns.
- In the first round, player X goes first, followed by player O, and so on. Use the queue to ensure a fair rotation of 
turns.
Game Features:

Score Keeping: Keep track of the score for both players (X and O). Display the current score at the end of each game.
Play Again Queue: After each game (win, draw, or player choice), prompt players to choose whether they want to play again.
If players choose to play again, reset the game grid and maintain the score.
Use the queue to manage the order of player turns for the next round.
Exit Game: If players choose not to play again, display the final score and exit the game.
 

This updated specification emphasizes the use of queues to manage player turns and rotation, ensuring fair play between players. 
The queue-based approach enhances the game and adds variety to the order of player turns.



It should be, instead, used to iteratively ask such questions as : 

Is my algorithm/code adhering to the SOLIDLinks to an external site. principles
Is this algorithm the most efficient for this purpose, and if not why
What would you suggest and why ?
Is my data structure the must efficient for this purpose, and what would you suggest I use otherwise ?
How can I make my code reusable  ? 
Does my UML capture the principles of OOD (you can copy and paste your UML, or type it in).
Is my algorithm tightly coupled 
etc.

For each question and answer, keep a running Google Doc, and paste your question, and its response, into the document.  (the responses can disappear, )
